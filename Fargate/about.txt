Uses Fargate Controller that is build using kubernetes upstream, extensible model
Fargate controller includes a new scheduler that runs ialong side default kubernetes  scheduler

When we start a pod that meets the criteria for running in fargate, fargate controller running
in the cluster recognize, update and schedue the pod onto fargate

AWS EKS on Fargate:

Bring existing pods 
    - dont need to change our existing pods
    - Forgate works with existing workflow and services that run on kubernetes

production ready: 1 pod = 1 fargate instance
    - Launch Pods easily
    - Easily run pods across AZs for have
    - Each pod runs in an isolated compute environment

so kubectl get nodes = kubectl get pods

Righsized and Integrated:
    - only pay for resoruces you need to run your pods
    - Includes native AWS integrations for networking and security


EKS deployment Options with Fargate:
    - Only EC2 Node Groups (managed and unmanaged EC2 nodes)
    - Mixed (like EC2 managed nodes, unmanaged nodes, fargate)
    - Only Fargate 

EKS deployment options with EC2 Managed Node Groups: We can deploy EC2 managed node groups in public and provate subnets in a vpc

EKS deployment options with Fargate: Pods on fargate runs only on private subnets
