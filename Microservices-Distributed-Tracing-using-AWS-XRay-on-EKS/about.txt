Helps Analyse and Debug distributed apps built using micro services architecture
we can understand how our app underlying services are performing to identiy the root cause of performance issues or error
provided end to end view of requests as they travel through the app and show a map of underlying components
can use it in dev and prod to analyse app

Benifits:
Review req behaviour
Discover app issues
improve app performance
ready to use with AWS


AWS Xray --> Collect traces  --> record traces or combine to singular units called traces --> view service map --> analyse issues


Daemon Set ensures that all or some nodes run a copy of prod
- As nodes are added to the cluster, pods are added to them
- As nodes are removed, those pods are garbage collected
- Deleting a Daemon set will clean up the pods it created


example:
running a logs collection daemon on every node (fluentd)
running a node monitoring daemon on every node (cloud watch agent)
running an app trace collection daemon on every node (xray)



architecture:


Xray pod in workernodes - xray cluster ip service
