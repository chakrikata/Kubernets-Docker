Services - NodePort
Expose an application running on a set up PODS using diff types of services like

ClusterIP - specific to a cluster, inside cluster can access using cluster ip
LoadBalancer - for cloud like ALB
NodePort - access app externally via internet

        Worker NodePort  -- > Cluster IP Service Port(this is nodeport service port) --> Container Port in a Pod
        https://worker-node:NodePort --> cluster IP service port --> container port

port: port on which node port service listens in Kubernetes cluster internally
target port: container port on which our app is running
NodePort: worker node port on which we can access app
