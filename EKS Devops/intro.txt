Source          --> Build               --> Test                    --> Deploy              --> Monitoring
Aws Code Commit  --> Aws Code Build --> Aws Code Build+Third pary --> Code Build + Kubectl --> Cloud watch container Insights

Use AWS Code pipeline to bring all above steps together

Steps To Perform:
We are going to create a ECR Repository for our Docker Images
We are going to create Code Commit Git Repository and check-in our Docker and Kubernetes Manifests
We will write a buildspec.yml which will eventually build a docker image, push the same to ECR Repository and Deploy the updated k8s Deployment manifest to EKS Cluster.
To achive all this we need also create or update few roles
STS Assume Role: EksCodeBuildKubectlRole
Inline Policy: eksdescribe
CodeBuild Role: codebuild-eks-devops-cb-for-pipe-service-role
ECR Full Access Policy: AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess
STS Assume Policy: eks-codebuild-sts-assume-role
STS Assume Role: EksCodeBuildKubectlRole

Pre-Requsite:

We are going to deploy a application which will also have a ALB Ingress Service and also will register its DNS name in Route53 using External DNS
Which means we should have both related pods running in our cluster.
# Verify alb-ingress-controller pod running in namespace kube-system
kubectl get pods -n kube-system

# Verify external-dns pod running in default namespace
kubectl get pods


Create ECR Repository for our Application Docker Images

Create CodeCommit Repository

Create STS Assume IAM Role for CodeBuild to interact with AWS EKS

Update EKS Cluster aws-auth ConfigMap with new role created in previous step

Review the buildspec.yml for CodeBuild & Environment Variables
Environment Variables for CodeBuild
REPOSITORY_URI = 180789647333.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/eks-devops-nginx
EKS_KUBECTL_ROLE_ARN = arn:aws:iam::180789647333:role/EksCodeBuildKubectlRole
EKS_CLUSTER_NAME = eksdemo1

Create CodePipeline

Updae CodeBuild Role to have access to ECR full access

Update CodeBuild Role to have access to STS Assume Role we have created using STS Assume Role Policy

Make changes to index.html file

Add change to Ingress manifest
