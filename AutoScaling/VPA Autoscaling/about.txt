VAP autoamtically adjusts CPU and memory reservations for pods to hep right size your app
This adjustment can improve cluter resource utilisation and free up CPU and memory for other pods

Benifit:
Cluster nodes are effectively used, as pods use exactly as they need
pods are scheduled onto nodes that have the appropriate resources available
also we dont have to run time-consuming benchmarking tasks to determine teh correct values for CPU and memory Requires
Maintenance time reduced, as autoscalar adjust CPU and memory req over time with out any action on our part

    VPA Admission Hook   -->  VPA Recommender   --> VPA Updater


VPA Admission Hook
    Every pod submitted goes throught this webhook automatically which check
    whether a VPA object referencing this pod or one of it parents(replica set , deployment)

VPA Recommender 
    Connects to metrics-server in cluster, fetches historical and current usage of cpu, memory for
    each pod and generates recommendation for scalling up or down the request, limits of pods

VPA Updater
    Runs every 1 min. If a pod is not running in the calculated recommendation range, it evicts current running pod
    so it can restart and go throught the VPA admission hook which will change the cpu and memory settings for it
