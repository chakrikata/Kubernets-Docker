Increasing or decreasing number of replicas (pod)
HPA Automatically scales no of pods in a deployment, replication controller or replica set, stateful set based on the resource utilisation
This helps apps to scale ou to meet increased demand and scale in when resource are not needed

we have to set target CPU utilisation percentage, so HPA will try to meet this target
HPA needs kubernetes metrics server to verify CPU metrics of pod


HPA is availabel by default.


HPA Requires 
- scaling metric- CPU utilisation
- Target value CPU - 50%
- Min Replicas  - 2
- Max Replicas  - 5


CMD:
kubectl autoscale deployment demo-dep1 --cpu-percent=50 --min=1 --max=3
