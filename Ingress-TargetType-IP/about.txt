Target Types- instance and ip mode
Instance mode is default and svc should be of nodeport or loadbalancer
Ip mode- is req for sticky session to work wit alb and fargate using only IP mode
        Need to define annotation explicity as target-type:ip
            # Target Type: IP
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
